# Elixir-Julia-Set-Multiprocessed
This is a multi-processed version of the Elixir Julia Set I wrote earlier.<br>
This one is more than 100% faster.<br>
The IO operations were redone as well.<br>
Therefore dumping the data for Python to read is MUCH faster.<br>
Along with this the Python3 script is automatically ran to display<br>
your image.<br>
Ps. This is my "third" Elixir program in the sense it's a rewrite of my<br>
earlier none multi-processed version.<br>
I'm still very new to Elixir so please bare with me.
This includes the Bonus #4 solution to the <br>
